CLASS BASE COMPONENTS:
We made User component to call it in About component.

A Class base component is just a normal javascript class. To create one we have to write class keyword and then name of the component and to make this a component what we will do is we will extends React.Component: i.e

class UserClass extends React.Component{

}
We have Render method inside it which gives us piece of JSX.
